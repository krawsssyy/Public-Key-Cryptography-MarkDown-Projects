# Public-key-cryptography-markdown-projects

This repository holds a number of 3 projects, each regarding a different notion tied to Public Key Cryptography and Number Theory. Each project consists of the markdown file which combines mathmatical proofs of the concepts I've used, along
with python code snippets which construct a full Python program able to perform the operations presented in the PDF.
